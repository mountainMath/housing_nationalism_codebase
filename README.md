# The Rise of Housing Nationalism in Canada and Transnational Property Ownership Patterns

This repository contains the codebase for the paper [*The Rise of Housing Nationalism in Canada and Transnational Property Ownership Patterns*](https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183X.2023.2293635) published in the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 2023-12-20.

The code for all the data processing and images in the paper is embedded in the [source quarto notebook for the paper](https://github.com/mountainMath/housing_nationalism_codebase/blob/main/housing_nationalism.qmd).
The paper relies on a custom tabulation of Hate Crime data from Statistics Canada, which can be found in the [`data` folder](https://github.com/mountainMath/housing_nationalism_codebase/tree/main/data). There is also Speculation and Vacancy Tax data that has been extracted from the provincial PDF reports using the code. A compiled preprint version of the PDF can be found [here](https://github.com/mountainMath/housing_nationalism_codebase/blob/main/housing_nationalism.pdf), and a web-friendly preprint version lives on the [GitHub pages](https://mountainmath.github.io/housing_nationalism_codebase/) for this repository.
